# notebooks folder

This folder can be used for any R scripts (or similar) that you are using to experiment with, but that you don't want to include within the R package itself. This is a good place to store scripts that you are using for package development, but eventually all of the R code that you intend to form part of the package should either be moved to the R/ folder (either as a function or as a help file) or under tests/testthat for unit testing.
